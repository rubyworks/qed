= Respect the Ruby

== Introduction

Respect is a Quality Assurance Suite for Ruby Developers 
consisting of a Literal-programming BDD framework, and 
a few other of useful tools.


== Features

=== Specifications

Respect's BDD system is uniqe in a few ways. First it utilizes
Ruby's Execption system to catch Assertions via assertion
<i>functors</i>. Eg.

    4.should == 5

Because 4 != 5, this expression will raise an Assertion exception.
Respect's Specification Runner class is thus just a means of running
and capturing these assertions. Respect if strict about the the use
of this functor --it does not riddle all objects with a smorgesboard
of secondary support methods.

BDD is a superset of TDD, so repspect provide TDD terminology as well
suiting the preferences of developers and the QA problem at hand.
The above can also be written as:

  4.assert == 5

or 

  4.expect == 5

The result is the same. Used in manner shown above the different terms do exactly
the same thing. Used with arguments however, they differ to conform with
the TDD vs. BDD prespective they intend to support.

  assert{ true }

  expect(4){ 4 }

Respect's Specifications themselves are simple
text files --a practice of literal programming. For example:

    Example Specification
    =====================

    Shows that the number 5 does not equal 4.

        5.should! == 4

    But in fact equals 5.

        5.should == 5

As you can see, we used Markdown for this spcecification. Almost any
format can be used. The only neccesary distinction is that desciption text be
align to the left margin and all specification code be indented. Respect also
recognized headers, currently Markdown and RDoc style headers, which covers
most markup foramts in common use today. While strictly speaking Qaurry
does not need to recognize headers, it does improve console output a bit
if it does.

Give this design some thought. It should become clear that this approach is
especially fruitful in that it allows documentation and specification to
seemlessly merge.

If we run this specification in verbatim mode the output would be identical
(assuming we did not make a typo and the assertions passed). If there were
errors or failures, we would see information detaling each.


=== Stubs, Mocks and Spies

Respect provides a flexible stubbing and mocking facility.

For now see RDoc API.

The Spy/Probe (aka the Duck Hunter) can dip-down into a method and
provide a read-out how it functions --known as a <i>method signature</i>.
Probe is somewhat expiremental becuase it is runtime bound, so proper
execution can not be 100% guarenteed.  It can miss some parts of a method
due to conditional branching (a probe can't pretend to be false) and,
albiet rare, it can also get stuck in an infinite loop a la the
Halting Problem. Even so, it can be used effectively under controlled
situations if used with care.
