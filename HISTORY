= RELEASE HISTORY

== 10.03.04 / 2010-03-04

This is a major new release of QED. All demonstration documents
are now converted to HTML via Tilt (http://github.com/tilt) before
being run through the test runner. So QED now supports any markup
format supported by Tilt, as well as ordinary HTML. Simply
stated, QED process <tt>pre</tt> tags as code and everything else
as comments. Nokogiri is used to parse the HTML.

Changes:

* HTML serves as a common format.
* New dependencies: Tilt and Nokogiri.
* New system of version numbers.
